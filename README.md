To complete this test:

1. Fork the github repository https://github.com/pvanheus/python2015_mt

2. Clone your forked repository (not the original) using `git clone`

3. `cd` into the resulting `python2015_mt` directory and start `ipython notebook` there.

4. Complete the exercises in the notebook, ensuring that the `assert` statements in the notebook don't generate errors.

5. Save the notebook and commit it to your git repository (with `git add` and `git commit`).

6. Push the final notebook to GitHub (`git push`) and send an email with a subject line like `PY2015MT https://github.com/exampleuser/python2015_mt` to pvh@sanbi.ac.za.
